# Memory game: Website version

This was an early prototype of my memory game which I made to develop the algorithm in. **Please do not grade this!!!**.
This folder exists for the purpose of education - for example if you want to see how I deleoped the algorithm or how to implement a similar game in javascript (and HTML).
